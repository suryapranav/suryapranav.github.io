Cannabis is a substance linked to India since the very beginning
(*Cannabis Indica*- It's in the name!). The first documentation of the
plant in India is in the Vedas, so anywhere from 1 400 to 2000 BCE![^1]
Just the age of the plant could be enough to classify it as inseparable
to the nation's culture- as it has found its way into the cuisine,
tradition, and religion of India. So it should come as no surprise that
marijuana usage was (and still is ) widespread in India.

Cannabis is more than just an old plant. Not only is it well-known as a
recreational and medicinal drug, but strains of the cannabis crop can be
used to make <u>rope, fabric, and possibly even semiconductors</u> [^2]

## Why we should Legalize Cannabis:

### Cannabis is less dangerous than already-legal drugs

The fundamental argument for the full legalization of the crop is simply
that it makes no sense for a plant with established, cultural and
medical uses to remain banned. Marijuana as a drug has been proven to be
less harmful than other, widely-available substances like alcohol or
tobacco[^3]. Therefore, legalizing the drug and giving adults the
**liberty** to access a cultural, medical, and recreational product
isn't unreasonable. I believe in making marijuana no less accessible
than cigarettes.

### Bans are expensive (and legalization is profitable)

Banning any addictive substance, let alone one of traditional
significance, is (for lack of a better description) a massive pain in
the rear ~~(source: trust me bro)~~. Not just history, but by the
present too is evidence of this. Weed is still found **everywhere** in
India, and perhaps not **despite** its legality, but **because** of it
(think: teens being drawn to exciting, illegal activities).

While I cannot claim that marijuana is totally safe- for a ban of such a
substance to be enforced properly, it would take an astronomical sum of
money. And it still cannot be 100% effective. The other possibility is
that it would spawn black markets giving people access to unregulated,
harmful variations of the plant, which is the state of things currently.

The fact is this: **the people want weed, and they will get weed.**
Whether they will get this from a regulated, safe dispensary or from a
drug dealer who laces it with fentanyl is the only thing that the
government can control.

Every pair of hands that a bag of marijuana crosses adds not just more
danger to the person smoking it, but also a rupee the government missed
out on. Not only can marijuana act as a source of income, legalizing it
can also let the government dictate who should (and shouldn't) have
access to herb. This allows prevention of the substance from reaching,
say, people with a history of mental illness or ex-convicts or
*teenagers*.

What's more is that severe punishments for possession will discourage
those who suffer from addictions to these substances to seek help or go
to rehab, fearing they might get be charged with crime.

### Marijuana as a medical herb

Marijuana is a drug with medicinal properties, and while some of the
rumored medicinal properties are proven, others are not. Those against
decriminalization of marijuana often cite the inefficiency of CBD
products as proof that the argument for medical marijuana is invalid[^4].
First of all, I believe that marijuana should be legalized even if it
has no medicinal properties (the other arguments for legalization are of
more importance). Secondly, inefficiencies in the current state of
cannabis-based drugs does not mean the plant itself lacks medical merit.
This makes an interesting case, and highlights the duality of the herb.

1.  Marijuana as tobacco

    One side of the leaf on making the case for (or against) marijuana
    is its recreational uses. This makes it similar to tobacco- both are
    addictive, recreational drugs.

    One might be less harmful, but make no mistake- there's no denying
    that both these substances have adverse effects on health. An
    extension of this fact is that both THC and nicotine cause more harm
    to teenagers than adults, meaning that it's more important to
    prevent this group from accessing the drug. Leaving things as they
    are, with a loosely-enforced ban, is the worst possible scenario.

2.  Marijuana as opium

    The other side of the leaf is that cannabis and cannabanoids possess
    medical properties. This aspect of the plant is similar to opium,
    the chemicals from which (*opioids and opiates*) are used for
    medical reasons. While opioids are considered to be more effective
    and specialized- CBD-based medicines have also showed efficacy[^5].
    While exact uses and efficacies of the chemicals are still under
    research[^6], the key point is that there is a wide array of
    possibilities with the drugs.

    In addition, it takes a long time to research and develop medicines.
    Developing drugs from the cannabis crop will take time- and it is
    harder to perform precise studies on the safety of the drug while
    it's illegal. Cannabis-based drugs require research and studies that
    could benefit immensely from its legalization.

### Marijuana is a gateway drug

Another often-used phrase in the marijuana debate is *"gateway drug"*.
The argument is that marijuana usage opens the gate and makes people
more likely to try out other, more dangerous drugs- like cocaine or
heroin.

This is obvious, considering the places that one has to go through to
obtain recreational marijuana. A cigarette smoker and a weed smoker have
to go to very different places to obtain their substances (one of which
consists of exposure to more serious crimes), and the only way to stop
this is to make cannabis available in safe, regulated places- in other
words, legalization.

Cannabis might be a gateway, and when closing it off entirely isn't
possible- the best thing to do is to protect those who enter it and
restrict entry.

### Conclusion

To conclude, I firmly believe that the issue with marijuana addiction
can be resolved only through legalization. Marijuana should be made
available to the consenting adult population, just like cigarettes. The
taxes paid by smokers should be used to rehabilitate addicts. Those
seeking the recreational or cultural aspects of pot should have the
liberty to do so; along with information on exactly how the plant is
damaging to health. In addition, pharmaceutical companies should
permitted to use cannabis and its derivatives in medical products for
research purposes.
