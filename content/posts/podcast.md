# Mohita's ideas

## How did I get here?

### [This link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVRfuP2MFPr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

### Step 1:

``` example
"I assert that the increasingly rapid rate at which images are distributed and consumed in late capitalism necessitates the corresponding increase in the rate that individuals assume and shed identities"
```

-   Inference from
    `Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Contemporary Visual Culture and the Acceleration of Identity Formation/Dissolution`

### Step 2:

``` example
Surya's proposed 3 layers of efficiency- efficiency in people generating content, efficiency in delivering content, efficiency in serving content.
```

-   Case study: Instagram's on_a_downward_spiral

### Technology changes

-   Phones being tailored to keep you on them for longer
-   phones transcending their traditional medium, entering brain chips,
    smartwatches, headphones, etc.

### The kind of memes that are shared

## "Despite differences in the type of media consumed, it remains an invariable fact that every individual in the 21st century consumes some amount of 'memetic' information"

### This can be through, say, TV or Movies.

1.  It is simply not possible to abstain from media altogether, is the
    chief point.

2.  "Escaping online activity is just impossible"

### The amount of *niche* media consumed is in part proportional to the exposure an individual receives

### Counterarguments :>
