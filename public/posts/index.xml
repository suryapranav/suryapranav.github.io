      <description>GitHub Copilot&amp;nbsp;¶What Copilot is&amp;nbsp;¶Microsoft-owned GitHub has caused quite a bit of commotion in the software scene [free or otherwise] with the announcement of GitHub Copilot, an ML using extension for Visual Studio Code trained on code from public repositories on the site.
