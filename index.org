** The History of Marijuana Usage in India and its uses
#+CAPTION: Parvati offering Shiva /Bhang/, a beverage made using cannabis

Cannabis is a substance linked to India since the very beginning (/Cannabis Indica/- It's in the
name!). The first documentation of the plant in India is in the Vedas, so anywhere from 1
400 to 2000 BCE![fn:1] Just the age of the plant could be enough to classify it as
inseparable to the nation's culture- as it has found its way into the cuisine, tradition, and religion
of India. So it should come as no surprise that marijuana usage was (and still is
) widespread in India.

# Traditionally, many parts of the cannabis crop are used in making consumable substances-
# /Charas/ from the resin, /Bhang/ from the leaves, and /Ganja/ from the flowers.

Cannabis is more than just an old plant. Not only is it well-known as a recreational and
medicinal drug, but strains of the cannabis crop can be used to make _rope, fabric, and
possibly even semiconductors_![fn:2]

# * Composition of the plant
# The two main substances in the plant (the /cannabinoids/) are THC and CBD. THC is a psychoactive element, and causes the "high" that comes with recreational forms of the of the plant. CBD, on the other hand, is a medicinal substance which is shown as an effective anti-seizure medicine, pain-reliever, and more.[fn:3]

** Why we should Legalize Cannabis:
*** Cannabis is less dangerous than already-legal drugs
The fundamental argument for the full legalization of the crop is simply that it makes no
sense for a plant with established, cultural and medical uses to remain banned. Marijuana
as a drug has been proven to be less harmful than other, widely-available substances
like alcohol or tobacco[fn:4]. Therefore, legalizing the drug and giving adults the *liberty*
to access a cultural, medical, and recreational product isn't unreasonable. I believe in
making marijuana no less accessible than cigarettes.

#+begin_quote

member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.

*** Bans are expensive (and legalization is profitable)

[[https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/P4iUHiPggG7vLRywAMcewnWiLPA=/0x331:3000x2019/1952x1098/media/img/mt/2015/06/AP321028026/original.jpg]]

Banning any addictive substance, let alone one of traditional significance, is (for lack
of a better description) a massive pain in the rear +(source: trust me bro)+. Not just
history, but by the present too is evidence of this. Weed is still found *everywhere* in
India, and perhaps not *despite* its legality, but *because* of it (think: teens being
drawn to exciting, illegal activities).

While I cannot claim that marijuana is totally safe- for a ban of such a substance to be
enforced properly, it would take an astronomical sum of money. And it still cannot be
100% effective. The other possibility is that it would spawn black markets giving
people access to unregulated, harmful variations of the plant, which is the state of
things currently.

The fact is this: *the people want weed, and they will get weed.* Whether they will get
this from a regulated, safe dispensary or from a drug dealer who laces it with fentanyl
is the only thing that the government can control.

# What's more; every illegal transaction involving marijuana adds danger and volatility
# for the users of the drug, but also adds to the cum of money that the government misses
# out on by not legalizing it.
Every pair of hands that a bag of marijuana crosses adds not just more danger to the
person smoking it, but also a rupee the government missed out on. Not only
can marijuana act as a source of income, legalizing it can also let the government
dictate who should (and shouldn't) have access to herb. This allows prevention of the
substance from reaching, say, people with a history of mental illness or ex-convicts or
/teenagers/.

What's more is that severe punishments for possession will discourage those who suffer from
addictions to these substances to seek help or go to rehab, fearing they might get be charged
with crime.

*** Marijuana as a medical herb
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100% :height 100%
#+CAPTION: Source: Harvard Health
[[https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/10941/iStock-1015545230.jpg]]

Marijuana is a drug with medicinal properties, and while some of the rumored medicinal
properties are proven, others are not. Those against decriminalization of marijuana often
cite the inefficiency of CBD products as proof that the argument for medical marijuana is
invalid[fn:5]. First of all, I believe that marijuana should be legalized even if it has no
medicinal properties (the other arguments for legalization are of more importance). Secondly,
inefficiencies in the current state of cannabis-based drugs does not mean the plant itself
lacks medical merit. This makes an interesting case, and highlights the duality of the herb.

**** Marijuana as tobacco
One side of the leaf on making the case for (or against) marijuana is its recreational uses.
This makes it similar to tobacco- both are addictive, recreational drugs.

One might be less harmful, but make no mistake- there's no denying that both
these substances have adverse effects on health. An extension of this fact is that both THC and
nicotine cause more harm to teenagers than adults, meaning that it's more important to prevent
this group from accessing the drug. Leaving things as they are, with a loosely-enforced ban, is
the worst possible scenario.

**** Marijuana as opium
The other side of the leaf is that cannabis and cannabanoids possess medical properties. This aspect
of the plant is similar to opium, the chemicals from which (/opioids and opiates/) are used for
medical reasons. While opioids are considered to be more effective and specialized- CBD-based
medicines have also showed efficacy[fn:6]. While exact uses and efficacies of the chemicals are still
under research[fn:7], the key point is that there is a wide array of possibilities with the drugs.

In addition, it takes a long time to research and develop medicines. Developing drugs from the cannabis
crop will take time- and it is harder to perform precise studies on the safety of the drug while it's
illegal. Cannabis-based drugs require research and studies that could benefit immensely from its
legalization.

*** Marijuana is a gateway drug
Another often-used phrase in the marijuana debate is /"gateway drug"/. The argument is that marijuana usage
opens the gate and makes people more likely to try out other, more dangerous drugs- like cocaine or heroin.

This is obvious, considering the places that one has to go through to obtain recreational marijuana. A cigarette
smoker and a weed smoker have to go to very different places to obtain their substances (one of which
consists of exposure to more serious crimes), and the only way to stop this is to make cannabis available
in safe, regulated places- in other words, legalization.

Cannabis might be a gateway, and when closing it off entirely isn't possible- the best thing to do is to protect
those who enter it and restrict entry.

*** Conclusion
To conclude, I firmly believe that the issue with marijuana addiction can be resolved only through legalization.
Marijuana should be made available to the consenting adult population, just like cigarettes. The taxes paid by
smokers should be used to rehabilitate addicts. Those seeking the recreational or cultural aspects of pot should
have the liberty to do so; along with information on exactly how the plant is damaging to health. In addition,
pharmaceutical companies should permitted to use cannabis and its derivatives in medical products for research
purposes.

* /GitHub/ Copilot
** What /Copilot/ is
Microsoft-owned /GitHub/ has caused quite a bit of commotion in the
software scene [free or otherwise] with the announcement of /GitHub
Copilot/, an ML using extension for Visual Studio Code trained on code
from public repositories on the site. While software assistance for
developers is not a remotely new concept, Copilot differs from other
services in its ability to create multiple lines, even entire functions
of code based on the name of a function and the developers' comments.
From the demos and previews on the copilot website, the description
"pair programmer" isn't all that inaccurate.


#+CAPTION: Source: GitHub

** How does it work?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: how-does-it-work
   :END:
The service is currently available in a technical preview, so things
might change- but fundamentally, Copilot uses OpenAI models [trained
from /GitHub/ code] to find the best match for the comments and the
function name provided to it by the IDE.

#+CAPTION: How GitHub Copilot works (Source: GitHub)

[[file:data/copilot.png]]

** Is this /legal/?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: is-this-legal
   :END:
There are two main points in the flow of data with the service that have
an ambiguous legal status:

- Firstly what would happen if the code from public repositories is
  licensed under a strong copyleft license [one which may require credit
  to be given to the original author if the code is reused]. Should
  Copilot have to comply with the licenses for processing code?
  [Exploring the legality of /training/ the AI.]
- And second, whether or not the "machine-generated" code is actually a
  derivative of the input code given to the AI. Should the users using
  Copilot have to follow the restrictions of the licenses of the
  training code on their own code? [Exploring the legality of /using/
  the AI.]

*** Is /training/ Copilot legal?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: is-training-copilot-legal
    :END:
This should come as no surprise, but the latest project of a
trillion-dollar corporation, is, in fact, legal. Ignoring ethical
concerns,
[[https://www.docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#4-license-grant-to-us][this
section]] of the /GitHub/ terms of service grants GitHub the right to
use your code- *regardless of license*.

This means that the first point holds no validity as long as Copilot is
trained using only the code hosted on /GitHub/. Even in the case that
this foreign code is used, the case could be made for the use of this
code is /transformative/, and possibly under the scope of fair use.

GitHub is safe here, as predicted by its CEO in
[[https://www.twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1409914420579344385][this
tweet]].

*** Is /Using/ Copilot legal?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: is-using-copilot-legal
    :END:
However, the second point is more interesting. In theory, the AI is
supposed to /understand/ public code to synthesize its own code based on
its /understanding/ of the code. Shown by
[[https://www.docs.github.com/en/github/copilot/research-recitation][this
case study]], it /is/ possible for the AI to reuse code from the public
repos, verbatim.

A hilarious example of this is Copilot's attempt to write an about-me
page, on which request
[[https://www.twitter.com/davidcelis/status/1410749792825737219?s=20][it
output the exact /GitHub/ bio of user David Celis]], and another where
the code is taken word-for-word from the
[[https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1410886329924194309?s=20][Quake
III game, including the swear-y comments]].

This means that however rarely, [GitHub published that the rate at which
this happens is around 0.1%, and is more common on files where Copilot
is given little to no information, or just empty files.] it's still
possible for code to be reused with no transformation, and this is the
situation with the highest legal ambiguity.

/GitHub/'s explanation for this is:

#+begin_quote
  This investigation demonstrates that /GitHub/ Copilot can quote a body
  of code verbatim, but that it rarely does so, and when it does, it
  mostly quotes code that everybody quotes, and mostly at the beginning
  of a file, as if to break the ice.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100% :height 100%
[[file:data/graph.png]]

Ultimately, it's not easy to determine exactly /what/ this code is- and
whether or not it's "machine-generated". This is more important that it
seems, especially for developers. For instance, code that is derived or
forked from a
[[https://www.twitter.com/eevee/status/1410037309848752128][project
licensed GPLv3]] is legally also supposed to be licensed under the same
GPLv3 license. Worse case scenario? This means that programmers might
unintentionally give up their freedom in licensing their software.

That's just the worse case scenario, however- because copyright laws are
a little more complicated. Julia Reda, a legislator at the EU writes:

#+begin_quote
  [...]it suggests that even reproducing the smallest excerpts of
  protected works constitutes copyright infringement. This is not the
  case. Such use is only relevant under copyright law if the excerpt
  used is in turn original and unique enough to reach the threshold of
  originality[...] The short code snippets that Copilot reproduces from
  training data are unlikely to reach the threshold of originality.
#+end_quote

#+BEGIN_CENTER
[[https://www.juliareda.eu/2021/07/github-copilot-is-not-infringing-your-copyright/][source]]
#+END_CENTER

This is just speculation, though. There are
[[https://www.fossa.com/blog/analyzing-legal-implications-github-copilot/][conflicti]][[https:/medium.com/geekculture/githubs-ai-copilot-might-get-you-sued-if-you-use-it-c1cade1ea229][ng opinions]]
from other legal experts- and only predictions can be made until a
judge's verdict is made, after the release of the software. The most
concerning factor, to me personally, is that the law might not be
equipped to properly deal with /GitHub/ copilot. This project is the
first of its kind- and the legislation that such a program has to be put
under is still unclear. This makes it all too easy to make an
insufficient or even incorrect judgement, and worse yet, this is the
link on the chain furthest from the control of the average person like
you or me. We can only hope that legislators are able to grasp the
nuance and difficulty in categorizing such an innovative, out-of-the-box
idea.

** Is this /ethical/?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: is-this-ethical
   :END:
As fun as it is for me to point at the rule book and scream "That's not
enough!" or "That's Kafkaesque!", the moral and philosophical issues are
probably more important here. They're also pretty straightforward:

: Is it ethical to use free/open-source code to make a proprietary service?

After all, /GitHub/ copilot trains on a heap of FOSS code, but the end
product of this training is a closed-source, paid-for product. While
this is clearly the most important issue, it's not one that I'm
qualified to pass judgment on. I believe that this is part of the
reasoning for a programmer to pick a particular license [for instance,
how /GPLv2/ or /WTFPL/ permit this, but the more popular /GPLv3/ does
not]. As a consequence of this belief, I think it's completely unethical
for /GitHub/ to ignore the choices of developers just because of a vague
clause in their terms of service, that most would not expect to be used
this way anyway. However, it's not all bad. /GitHub/ acknowledges the
choice of the end user to determine if the source of code is okay to be
used in their project, and write this:

#+begin_quote
  The answer is obvious: sharing the prefiltering solution we used in
  this analysis to detect overlap with the training set. When a
  suggestion contains snippets copied from the training set, the UI
  should simply tell you where it's quoted from. You can then either
  include proper attribution or decide against using that code
  altogether.

   :END:
*** Copilot is not free software
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: copilot-is-not-free-software
    :END:
There are many other "issues" regarding copilot-and not just about
legality- some of which the Free Software Foundation has published
[[https://www.www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsf-funded-call-for-white-papers-on-philosophical-and-legal-uestions-around-copilot][here]].
The FSF requests developers not to use the service, citing its
dependencies on proprietary software (particularly VSCode). The FSF also
recommends
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria%20evaluation.html#/GitHub/][doing
away with GitHub entirely]].

*** Copilot is biased
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: copilot-is-biased
    :END:
Perhaps as an artifact of being trained mostly from one source, Copilot
might have inherent biases and inefficiencies- as pointed out by
[[https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03374.pdf][this paper]]. In the words
of Kyle Wiggers:

#+begin_quote
  After repeated sampling from the model, where Codex was given 100
  samples per problem, OpenAI says it manages to answer 70.2% of the
  HumanEval challenges correctly. But the company's researchers also
  found that Codex proposes syntactically incorrect or undefined code,
  invoking functions, variables, and attributes that are undefined or
  outside the scope of the codebase.
#+end_quote

#+BEGIN_CENTER
[[https://www.venturebeat.com/2021/07/08/openai-warns-ai-behind-githubs-copilot-may-be-susceptible-to-bias/][source]]
#+END_CENTER

My personal bet as to why this might be is simple: Garbage in, garbage
out. Copilot is not trained on high-quality code, but rather from
popular repositories on /GitHub/ with up to hundreds of contributors
each- and not all of these files are full of high-quality code. In other
words, /garbage in, garbage out/. It's possible to tune the training
dataset go get rid of redundant code, but it's a lot of work: and
/mannual, human work/ at that. I'd only expect the quality of code to go
up /after/ launch, when bad code is rejected by the users, giving the AI
a chance to analyze what kind of code is accepted more often.

*** Copilot might not be /useful/?

I've been going on about the legal implications of this product, mainly
because it seemed very interesting to me [and also because I'm not
qualified or experienced enough to discuss the user experience]- but the
elephant in the room is obviously the actual utility of this service...
which seems to be hit or miss.

[[https://www.www.fast.ai/2021/07/19/copilot/][This article]] (that I
highly recommend you read), written by a co-author of the paper that
inspired the creation of the /Codex/ backend of Copilot, claims that the
dips in quality of code might be due to the behavior of the code
algorithms. He even calls Copilot "[...] /worse/ than the average
programmer [in some ways]", referring to how unlike humans, Copilot's
entire knowledge comes from public code, with no regard to
documentation, compiler warnings, et cetera.

#+begin_quote
  The thing to remember is that Copilot is an early preview of a very
  new technology that's going to get better and better. There will be
  many competitors popping up in the coming months and years, and
  /GitHub/ will no doubt release new and better versions of their own
  tool.
#+end_quote

** Conclusion
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: conclusion
   :END:
Obviously, Copilot has its flaws. Duh. But like Jeremy Howard writes...

#+begin_quote
  Complaining about the quality of the code written by Copilot feels a
  bit like coming across a talking dog, and complaining about its
  diction. The fact that it's talking at all is impressive enough!
#+end_quote

Truly, /GitHub/ Copilot is a step forward for programmers. Contesting
/if/ it should exist is out of the question. Really, the only question
here is /how/ it should be implemented- and I think that most of the
flaws will be ironed out with time. I'm nothing but excited to
see the effects of such a program, and I hope it reduces the barrier to
programming!
